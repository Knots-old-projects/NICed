## Questions

### How complete is the project?

Currently, only track piece (3d tiles) editing works. But if you load an already-done map, it's strats, lights and other object types will at least be presevered.

### Where does the name come from?

**N**on-**I**nteractive **C**roc **Ed**itor. Nic is also the name of the game's lead designer, Nic Cusworth, so that is kind of nice. :)
