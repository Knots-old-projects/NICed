FILE LOADING AND SAVING

load <filepath>
	Load the JSON or MAP format file at <filepath>. In order to save your maps to MAP files
	you need to set the croctool path.

save <filepath>
	Save the JSON or MAP format file to <filepath>. In order to save your maps to the raw
	(native) Croc map format, you need to have croctool available. If you don't specify a
	file path, it will be saved to the same path as the file that you opened.

TRACKS
	You are given a slot that contains a single track piece's data. You can then update
	any track piece index with the data at this slot, or load a current track piece's
	data into this slot, in order to minipulate track pieces.
	
	To load a track at a given index for editing, use "track.use <index>". To save edits
	to a track, use "track.set <index>". You can use different indexes for "use" and "set"
	to save a track to a different index than the one you loaded it from.
	
	To make edits, use the "track.pos", "track.rot" and "track.tile" commands.
	
	To list all tracks in the map, use the "track.list" command.
	
	Example:
		track.use 0
		track.pos 1 1 2
		track.show
		track.set 2

track.list
	List track pieces in the current track

track.remove <index>
	Remove the track at <index>.

track.use <index>
	Set the current track style to match the one at <index>. Note that this is a completely
	seprate track object and won't save until you use "track.set".

track.set <index>
	Set the track at <index> to match the current track data.

track.pos <x> <y> <z>
	Set the position for the current track data.

track.rot <y-rot>
	Set the rotation (along the upward (Y) axis) for the current track piece.

track.tile <index>
	Set the tile index for the current track to <index>.

track.show
	Print information about the current track data.

GENERAL COMMANDS

shell <command>
	Run <command> in the system shell. This is nice to be able to quickly check things
	without leaving NICed.

help
	Print this help message.

exit
	Exit NICed. Your work will not be saved until you use save!
